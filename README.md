# SH-ESP32 NMEA 2000 gateway

SH-ESP32 NMEA 2000 gateway is an NMEA 2000 USB gateway software for the [Sailor Hat with ESP32](https://hatlabs.github.io/sh-esp32) development board, available for purchase at https://hatlabs.fi.
If you take an SH-ESP32 board, connect it to an NMEA 2000 panel, flash the firmware in this repository using PlatformIO, and then connect it to the NMEA 2000 network and a computer USB port, you'll have a fully functioning Actisense NGT-1 replacement for a fraction of the cost!
